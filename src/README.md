### Details

In the following route you can find the library ready for implementation and use: alerts / alerts.
The way to instantiate each of the alerts is as follows: `new alertas.AlertSuccess(this, true).setVisible(true);`
Remember that these dialogs receive by parameter a unique component, the JFrame Form, so you must have at least one JFrame as the main class when using this library.
Well, the source code is very easy to understand and if you want to change something to these alerts, you must open the source code and customize them to your liking to later generate the .jar file again
It should be noted that a package of images was used to design these alerts, which you can find at the following link: [Handz](https://www.handz.design/)
